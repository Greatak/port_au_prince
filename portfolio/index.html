    <p>Part of Public Participation coursework, this project consisted initially of a census of Ohio government officials to determine what issues were facing communities in Ohio to allow the CDFA to better serve their purpose.</p>
    <p>This is part of our final analysis, an interactive map to plot the results of the survey. It's a custom GIS solution to track responses in a generalized format, anonymized to a county level. Dedicated efforts were made to ensure cross-browswer performance.</p>

    <p>Given a week to come up with a proposal for an app to facilitate an aspect of public engagement. This project was for a stripped-down SimCity-alike to gather ideas from the public on vacant sites and parking lots.</p>
    <p>This is a custom-mock up of the app with limited functionality intended to demonstrate how it might work.</p>

    <p>Toledo is one of the Rust Belt's minor cities, but equally crippled from the economic transition that moved industry away from the area. However, it has proven successful in reviving a fledgling industry in solar energy and reorganizing transportation networks. The regional development organization was the subject of this investigation.</p>
    <p>Though this lacks any significant technical work, it was prototyped in a new style with a presentation tool currently under development.</p>

    <p>The near south side of Columbus was the focus of a project studying crime and safety issues in low income urban areas in Columbus. The Parsons Avenue area was the focus of a study of crime patterns.</p>
    <p>This is the status of the project partway through our investigation, highlighted as a fairly successful interface prototype; the earliest of such endeavors.</p>
